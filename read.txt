Originals Folder contains the files as they were downloaded.

Below are small descriptions  of the files which have been slightly modified.
Ex of Modifications:
- Renaming the files to make content more obvious.
- Renaming columns to make content more obvious.
- Make columns names consistent across files to make it easier to write functions for automatic lookup eventually.

If you’re not use to output areas, don’t confuse by the names lower super output areas are larger than output areas (they are generally made up of four to six output areas), it’s the “super” that matters here not the “lower”. This is done to allow data provider to release content that could be disclosive if published by output areas.

oa_to_pcs.csv matches output areas to postcode sector for England and Wales. The original for this was published by the ONS in August 2016. The output areas are those of 2011. Relations are not unique, more than one lower super output area can be match to the same postcode.
*Not sure why there are some double space in some postcodes. Might be so they fit eight character postcode format, rather than seven charactre format.*

pc_to_oa_lsoa_msoa_lad.csv matches postcodes (seven and eight character format) to output areas, lower super output areas (code and name), middle super output areas (code and name), local authority district (code, name and welsh name) for England and Wales. The original for this was published in August 2016. The outuput areas are those of 2011. There is a boolean numeric indicator to know if the postcode is split between more than one output area (“1” if True, “0” if False). They are however linked to only one output area in the file, “best-fitted by plotting to the postcode’s mean”.
